# AustralianRainPrediction
In this lab machine learning models will be used to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. The dataset was taken from [rattle](https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData). Data was processed by converting categorical variables into numeric and replacing null values with most frequent values. Exploratory data analysis and visualisation was done. Furthermore, the data was split into traning and testing datasets. Machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and SVM) were used to train the model. Additionally, models were evaluated using Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and R2-Score.
